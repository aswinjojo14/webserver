# webserver
Web server in c

This is a very simple HTTP server. Default port is 10000 and ROOT for the server is your current working directory..

You can provide command line arguments like:- $./a.aout -p [port] -r [path]

for ex.
$./a.out -p 50000 -r /home/
to start a server at port 50000 with root directory as "/home"
